## About Me
##### My goal is to become a professional and be competent in IT development and then transfer my knowledge to my colleagues in the company. Now I want to hold the office of Junior-developer. However, I am sure that after some time I will develop my technical skills and be able to move forward, and my soft skills developed in an international company will help me in this.
